The Music Project is a project that allows users to listen to a variety of music (in this case, just sample pieces of music that are royalty free) and upload their own music.  This project was created by David Trinh and Hector Lovo to help us improve our development skills, while learning new technologies. It utilizes the latest cutting edge technologies. Codes in this project may not have top quality,
since we were limited on time, but we did strive to do our best with a small timeframe.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## API Server

API server will be located at `http://localhost:3000/`.
